# Axe / Not Axe

## What is it?

*Axe / Not Axe* is a role-playing game about Dwarves. They'll do Dwarf stuff,
like hoarding treasures, looting dungeons, fighting a lot of ennemies of various
types and sizes, drink beers, sing songs (loudly).

## Character Creation

Each Player Character (PC) is a Dwarf. Give him (or her) a Dwarf name, and
eventually a surname (Red beard, Black teeth, etc). Try to build a background
around this character (family, origin, occupation, motivations, etc).

### Stat

Dwarves have only *one* stat: ``Axe``. It is used to hit something / someone
with your Axe.

Assign a score to your stat. The maximum score is +2. The minimum score is -2.
Bear in mind that for **any other Move**, you'll have to **substract** your
``Axe`` score instead of adding it.

### Armor Class

* No Armor = AC 0
* Leather Armor = AC 1
* Chain Mail = AC 2
* Plate Armor = AC 3

For every Move that implies rapid movement (fighting, running, jumping,
tumbling), and if your character is wearing this armor, substract the AC from
the roll. It applies to both ``Axe`` and ``Not Axe`` Moves.

Every time an ennemy hits you, substract your AC from the Hits taken.

You can have a shield during the battle. Carrying it gives you +1 to AC. But
you have a -1 malus to any of your attacks.

### Other scores

#### Hit points

At the beginning of the game, your Hit Points score is ``10+Axe``. It'll never
be above this level. That's the maximum number of hits you can receive before
dying.

See the *Extra moves* section when you need to heal.

#### Weapon damage

Your Axe inflicts d10 damage. Eventually add damages if fighting your Nemesis
or if your Axe is providing a bonus.

If you try to hit with another weapon, and you succeed, you will inflict less
damages:

* Bare hands: d4,
* Dagger, Knife, Short sword, Bow: d6,
* Long sword, Hammer, Spear, Crossbow: d8,

### Ennemies

Chose your Nemesis: a specific type of ennemy that you're more motivated to
destroy.

Pick one type of ennemy you'll get a +1 bonus with **for any action** when you
oppose to this type of ennemy. It can be during a Fight with ``Axe`` Moves, but
it could be a ``Not Axe`` Move, as long as it goes against the designated
Nemesis.

Pick another you'll get a +1 Damage bonus.

These advantages can be cumulative.

Here are a few suggestions: Elves, Trolls, Orcs, Goblins, Elves, Kobolds,
Dragons, Elves, Werewolves, Skeletons, Humans, Halflings... or Elves?

### Equipment & Gear

Your Axe is your life, you can't even think living without it. It is special.
Pick two:

* Sharp: +1 damages,
* Light: Gives +1 to your ``Axe`` or ``Not Axe`` move that imply AC malus,
* Famous: Gives +1 bonus when trying to influence other Dwarves who know you're
  holding it,
* Slayer: +2 damages when hitting your Nemesis,
* Enchanted: Glows when your Nemesis is approaching,
* Flying: Once per fight scene, you can perform a double attack on two ennemies
  simultaneously,

## Basic Moves

For every move, you roll two six-sided dice (2d6)

### You hit with your Axe

You ``roll+Axe``. on 6-: you miss and the GM picks two, on 7-9: you hit, but you
pick one, on 10+: you inflict appropriate damages.

* You take damages,
* You lose your advantage, you cannot attack next turn,
* Your next attack is more difficult: apply a -2 malus,
* Your next attack will be less effective, apply a -4 malus to next damages,
* You're on the defensive side: apply a -2 malus to your next attack, but a
  -3 damage if you're hit

### Everything else

You ``roll-Axe``. on 6-: You fail, the GM tells what's happening, on 7-9: you
succeed, but there's a cost, on 10+: you succeed and you tell what's happening.

### Hit Someone Or Something With A Weapon That Is Not Your Main Weapon

I already see some naughty players trying to: set a negative "Axe" score, and
perform *every* other move (combat or off-combat) with a positive score.
Including fighting with a weapon that is not your Axe.

Tsk. You can't cheat with this. Dwarves don't cheat.

Here's the This Is Not Your Main Weapon Rule:

> EVERY TIME SOME CHARACTER IS TRYING TO HIT SOMETHING WITH A WEAPON THAT IS NOT
> HIS/HER MAIN WEAPON, HE/SHE SUFFERS A **NEGATIVE** SCORE.

That is to say that if your Axe score is +2, you'll have a -2 malus. And if
you've set a -2 Axe score, you'll **still** have a -2 malus.

The "only" way out is to set a +0 ``Axe`` score. But you'll not get a big
advantage. You'll **still** be at +0/-0 for all of your Moves. Your choice.

## Extra Moves

### Heal

After the adventure, when you have time, you can try to heal from your wounds.

To regenerate, Dwarves drink beer(s). Each time you drink a beer, you roll 2d6.
If it's equal or above your current HP, you gain 1 HP. If it's below, you pick
one of the following:

* You gain one more HP, but right after it, you fall drunk dead. Everybody
  laughs at you, you're shameful.
* You fail to gain one HP, you can still try one more time, but if you fail
  again, you fall drunk dead, without your extra HP.

Otherwise, you could longer to regain your HPs, at the rate of 1HP/week.

## Example Ennemies

*Note:* please mind that this game is compatible with the monsters / ennemies in
Dungeon World and hacks, just because Hit Points and Damage dice match with it.

## Hackish hacks

Some players may want to use another main weapon. It might be a *Mace*, a
*Spear*, or a *Hammer*, for example. Even if it might look like blasphemy from
the Orthodox point of view, it could be allowed by the GM.

Simply replace the word "Axe" with your weapon of choice. But remember: the Holy
Hit Someone Or Something With A Weapon That Is Not Your Main Weapon Rule will
still be valid. Every character can only have **one** main weapon, and every
other weapon will have a **negative** score applied.

## Inspirations

* [Lasers & Feelings](http://www.onesevendesign.com/laserfeelings/), by John
  Harper (just one score, if you're good at something, you're bad for the
  opposite),
* "I hit it with my axe", by Brian Engard, included in the
  [Rough cuts](http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/120165/Rough-Cuts-6-Micro-Games?filters=0_2810_0_0_0)
  collection. Just Axe and Not Axe as scores. But the game mechanics didn't fit
  my needs, to I've tried to build around the concept of having Dwarf-only RPG.
