# Axe / Not Axe

This is a Role Playing Game.

In this game, all the Playing characters are Dwarves.

And they all have an Axe. They use it to hit things or people.

For everything else, they don't use their Axe.

Note: this game is available in both [French](hache-pas-hache.md) and [English](axe-not-axe.md)

### Inspirations

* Lasers & Feelings, by John Harper (just one score, if you're good at
  something, you're bad for the opposite),
* "I hit it with my axe", by Brian Engard, included in the
  [Rough cuts](http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/120165/Rough-Cuts-6-Micro-Games?filters=0_2810_0_0_0)
  collection. Just Axe and Not Axe as scores. But the game mechanics didn't fit
  my needs, to I've tried to build around the concept of having Dwarf-only RPG.
